Task1:

Michael Bradley, ProjectListGenerator.java: 
The ProjectListGenerator class works by first creating a list of StaffMember instances using the info from the rows of Miskatonic Staff Members.csv.
It then proposes from those staffMembers a list of random Project instances of size n, where each project has a unique staffMember/Supervisor.
If in the proposed list contains a set of Supervisors where between all Supervisors it is possible to generate a total of n*3
projects then we add an additional n*2 projects to our list of projects using only previously used supervisors and write it to ProjectList.csv.
If the proposed list doesn't contain a suitable set of Supervisors then we remove 10 staff members who are not capable of generating 3=< projects and
propose a new list (We remove projects to significantly reduce processing time).

Donnchadh Robinson, StudentGenerator.Java:
The student generator creates a lists of the CS, DS projects and the list of student names.
Using the information found in the ProjectList.csv file and the names.csv . The name and
ID of each student is then generated. Then a list of projects is created with it's preference 
percentages decided by the normal distribution. The student is then assigned a random stream
based on the 60/40 split. The student is then assigned 10 projects based on the preferences
previously decided. 




Normal Distribution:
To create the normal distribution the project uses three lists that it assigns projects to.
The lists are shuffled so that they are random for each list of preferences.
The list is then broken into thirds and different percentages are assigned to each.
The first third of the list is 68% likely to be chosen.
The second third is 27% likely to be chosen.
The third list is 5% likey to be chosen.
This will create the standard deviation in the preference lists of the students. 

Task2:
We took in the information from the files and used an
if statement to detect if a csv or tsv file was being read in 
and changed the delimiter accordingly. This information was then
stored in lists for further use. We added code to account for things
like extra white spaces, comma's within the text for csv's and similar 
situations. 

We tested the code using a varity of files with a few different errors.
Including files missing information and files with extra unwanted characters.

Task3:
We used the preference list generated in the previous task to create our solution.
Lists were used to organize and store this information.
The solutions were stored as an integer that relates to an index stored in the project lists. 


Task4:
SimulatedAnnealing class contains three static methods, Fitness(), Energy(), and ChangeRandom().
Fitness calculates the fitness of a CandidateSolution argument based on soft and hard constraints. Given that it is still possible for a two students to be assigned the same project and likely to happen the energy returned is often 0. 
Energy returns the inverse of Fitness (or infinity if fitness is 0).
ChangeRamdom takes a CandidateSolution as an argument and randomly changes one students project to another one from their preference list. 

A basic menu was added to allow easy navigation of the program and to allow the solution to be worked on without generating a new solution each time. 


Task 5: Simulated Annealing was implemented in the HillClimbingWithSA class (built from HillClimbing class), the initial temperature of 100 was chosen with a cooling schedule that cools by 10 for each random change that is accepted. This cooling schedule was chosen as from testing it gave the best results.

Task 6: The GAMate class contains the static mate method, this method takes 2 candidate solutions and generates an offSpring. an offSpring is generated by interlacing entries from each solution (every ith entry is from solution 1, every i+1th entry is from solution 2). If a student has a project that has already appeared in the offSpring, that entry is mutated and the project is moved to the next down from that project of that students preferences. From testing this method has roughly a 0.00001% chance of producing a degenerate, which is sufficiently low for our purposes.
The GeneticAlgorithm class creates a number of solutions. It then adds these solutions to a list where they are sorted based on their fitness. Then the top 10% of the list of solutions are given the chance to mate. Mating is done at random so not all of the top 10% will sucessfully mate and some may mate more than once. There is a 3% chance that a solution that is not in the top 10% will be allowed to mate. Allowing fresh solutions to enter the pool of solutions and helping to reduce issues that may occure from limiting the mating to the top 10%. Then the solutions are ranked by fitness again and the bottom 10% is culled.
This process is repeated until new lists of solutions are created with no improvement.
